## Caesar Cipher
A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 11 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on. The method is named after Roman leader Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
